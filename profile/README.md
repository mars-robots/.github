## Goal: Accelerate Mars Colonisation.

Starship payload capacity to mars is 100+ tonnes. Assume, >10 starships landing on Mars in 2030. Who is building stuff for Mars? 

- SpaceX prolly cannot since all resources are diverted to scale Starship
- That leaves NASA and defense contractors. Unfortunately, they are slow and expensive. Ingenuity cost $80 mil.

We’ll build the infrastructure required to establish human colonies on Mars in a way that is cheap and safe + enable other businesses to build on Mars. Moreover, we’ll do it as fast as possible.

This is a bet on Starship reaching Mars. Once it does, it’s an announcement to the world saying that Mars is open for business, come build for it. I’m starting now. I never want to see SpaceX scale back production or their plans because they cannot figure out what to transport or where to source essential things. Assume Starship lands on Mars in 2026/7 then we have 3-4 years to build stuff for it. Perfect.

Moreover, my gut says now is the time to build it since spacex was the first mover in disrupting defense contractors, changing nasa culture a lil, ingenuity costing so much but being so successful and laying building blocks. A lot of people/projects faced the initial brunt, the timing is also perfect rn.

### Why drones

Drones are the next robots we need on mars to further understand the planet. 

- satellites cannot detect on the ground info or obstructed views or high def images
- go to locations inaccessible by rovers, also rovers slow. separate roles, let drones do the scouting, collection and delivery. rovers should just be big ass scientific labs that process the stuff drones get them.
- explore biologically sensitive zones

Ingenuity proved that flight is possible on Mars + it far exceeded its lifetime/expectations/mission. 

Even if drones don’t work coz of design/economics/feasibility then vvv likely i would’ve figured out what initial infra I can build to speed up colonization + I’ll have enough contacts/resources.

### How tf is this company going to make money?

Great question, I have no idea, but I will figure it out.
