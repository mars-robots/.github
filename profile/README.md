## Goal: Accelerate Mars Colonisation.

Starship payload capacity to mars is 100+ tonnes. Assume >10 starships landing on Mars in 2030. Who is building stuff for Mars? 

- SpaceX prolly cannot since all resources are diverted to scale Starship
- That leaves NASA and defense contractors. Unfortunately, they are slow and expensive. Ingenuity cost $80 mil.

We’ll build the infrastructure required to establish human colonies on Mars in a way that is cheap and safe + enable other businesses to build on Mars. Moreover, we’ll do it as fast as possible.

This is a bet on Starship reaching Mars. Once it does, it’s an announcement to the world saying that Mars is open for business, come build for it. I’m starting now. I never want to see SpaceX scale back production or their plans because they cannot figure out what to transport or where to source essential things. Assume Starship lands on Mars in 2026/7 then we have 3-4 years to build stuff for it. Perfect.

Moreover, my gut says now is the time to build it since spacex was the first mover in disrupting defense contractors, changing nasa culture a lil, ingenuity costing so much but being so successful and laying building blocks. A lot of people/projects faced the initial brunt, the timing is also perfect rn.

### Why drones

Drones are the next robots we need on mars to further understand the planet. 

- satellites cannot detect on the ground info or obstructed views or high def images
- go to locations inaccessible by rovers, also rovers slow. separate roles, let drones do the scouting, collection and delivery. rovers should just be big ass scientific labs that process the stuff drones get them.
- explore biologically sensitive zones

Ingenuity proved that flight is possible on Mars + it far exceeded its lifetime/expectations/mission. 

Even if drones don’t work coz of design/economics/feasibility then vvv likely i would’ve figured out what initial infra I can build to speed up colonization + I’ll have enough contacts/resources.

### How tf is this company going to make money?

Great question, I have no idea, but I will figure it out. I also need to figure out use cases for here on Earth. Is there a market for drones that work at 100,000 feet or operate at -50 celcius? Everyone including me will probably benefit from faster feedback loops and generate a sense of emergency when the launch window is 2 years from now.

I do suspect that hiring is going to be relaively easy for this. If you like space and want to buiuld rockets go to SpaceX. If you like space and do not want to build rockets then come work here. Regardless of your discipline (in the long run) there will be a LOT you can contribute to building a new world on Mars. In the long-long run, the company becomes a world building company and makes sustainable robot colonies on different planets.


I dont know if im overfitting but if agi comes in <10 years, then idk how the societal structures will be post agi but we would prolly explore the universe, so this fits in. So with or without agi this company probably makes sense.

the world is focused on artermis rn. even better.


if you are interested in space, mars, aerospace, defense, plumbing, agriculture, manufacturing, electrical engineering, basically any skill/product that will be required to build a self-sustaining city on Mars, dm me on twitter->https://twitter.com/Rayquaza737
